## Workflow Under Test
**File**: `.github/workflows/pr-body-ai-attribution-check-reusable.yml`

**Test Repository**: `~/workspace/github-workflow-test`
**Test Date**: 2025-10-21

## Critical Findings (Pre-Testing Analysis)

### üêõ Bug #1 (HIGH SEVERITY): W1th Leetspeak Bypass
**Status**: CONFIRMED by code inspection
**Location**: normalize() function (lines 34-43)
**Issue**: Missing pre-normalization of w1th/w17h/w!th ‚Üí with

**Expected Behavior**: "G3n3r4t3d w1th C1aud3" should be BLOCKED
**Current Behavior**: Likely BYPASSED (w1th ‚Üí wlth, not "with")

**Fix Required**: Add before general leetspeak replacement:
```javascript
text = text.replace(/w1th/g, 'with');
text = text.replace(/w17h/g, 'with');
text = text.replace(/w!th/g, 'with');
```

**Same bug was fixed in**: issue-ai-attribution-check-reusable.yml (commit 1c65f98)

### üêõ Bug #2 (MEDIUM SEVERITY): Generic Pattern False Positives
**Status**: CONFIRMED by code inspection
**Location**: genericPatterns array (line 87)
**Issue**: Pattern too broad - catches descriptive "with AI" mentions

**Expected Behavior**: "Integration with AI API" should PASS (not attribution)
**Current Behavior**: Likely FALSE POSITIVE (matches "with AI")

**Fix Required**: Require attribution verbs:
```javascript
// OLD (line 87):
/\b(with|by|using|via|from|thanks to)\s+(AI|artificial intelligence|chatbot|chat bot|language model|LLM)\b/i,

// NEW (require verbs):
/\b(generated|created|built|written|made|developed|coded|implemented)\s+(with|by|using)\s+(AI|artificial intelligence|chatbot|chat bot|language model|LLM)\b/i,
/\bAI\s+(assistance|help|support)\b/i,
/\b(with|using|via)\s+(AI\s+)?(assistance|help|support)\b/i,
```

**Same bug was fixed in**: issue-ai-attribution-check-reusable.yml (commit 1c65f98)

## Test Strategy

### ‚úÖ UPDATED APPROACH: Option C - Leveraged PR #23 Merge

**Decision**: After systematic analysis (see CLAUDE.md /motto), chose Option C:
1. Validated PR #23 completeness ‚Üí ‚úÖ Complete
2. Merged PR #23 to master ‚Üí ‚úÖ Merged at 2025-10-21T17:51:11Z
3. Applied same fixes to pr-body-ai-attribution ‚Üí ‚úÖ Applied (commit ea3bbc4)
4. Test fixed version ‚Üí ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS

**Rationale**:
- Bugs confirmed via code inspection (most reliable method)
- PR #23 provides proven fixes (tested in Issue #16)
- Avoids duplicate testing of identical bugs
- Faster path to production-ready workflow
- Maintains consistency between issue-ai-attribution and pr-body-ai-attribution

### Test Phases (Modified)

**Phase 1: SKIPPED** - Bugs confirmed via code inspection
- ‚úÖ Bug #1 confirmed: normalize() missing w1th pre-normalization
- ‚úÖ Bug #2 confirmed: genericPatterns too broad (same as Issue #16)

**Phase 2: COMPLETED** - Fixes applied from PR #23
- ‚úÖ Fix #1: Added w1th/w17h/w!th ‚Üí with pre-normalization
- ‚úÖ Fix #2: Required attribution verbs in generic patterns

**Phase 3: IN PROGRESS** - Validate fixed version
- ‚è≥ Test subset of attack vectors to confirm 0% bypass rate and 0% false positive rate
- Focus on critical test cases (w1th bypass, false positives, standard attribution)

## Testing Methodology

### Test Execution Steps
1. Switch to test repository: `~/workspace/github-workflow-test`
2. Create PR with specific body content
3. Check workflow run result (pass/fail)
4. Document result in this file
5. Close PR (don't merge)
6. Repeat for all test cases

### Test Repository Setup
```bash
cd ~/workspace/github-workflow-test
git checkout main
git pull
```

### Creating Test PRs
```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout -b test-pr-body-ai-X

# Make dummy change
echo "test" >> test-file.txt
git add test-file.txt
git commit -m "test: PR body validation test X"

# Push and create PR with specific body
git push origin test-pr-body-ai-X
gh pr create --title "Test X: Description" --body "SPECIFIC_TEST_BODY"
```
