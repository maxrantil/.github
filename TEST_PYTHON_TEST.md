# ABOUTME: Attack testing results for python-test-reusable workflow
# Python Test Workflow Testing

**Workflow**: `python-test-reusable.yml`
**Test Repository**: `~/workspace/github-workflow-test`
**Testing Date**: 2025-10-18
**Issue**: #13
**Target**: 0% bypass rate (7th consecutive workflow)

---

## Testing Philosophy

**Goal**: Prove the workflow cannot be bypassed with creative test violations or coverage tricks.

**Approach**: Four-phase attack testing with increasing complexity.

---

## Workflow Under Test

### Python Test Execution

**Test Job**:
- **Python Version**: Default 3.11 (configurable)
- **Package Manager**: UV (mandatory per CLAUDE.md)
- **Default Install**: `uv sync`
- **Default Test**: `uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing`
- **Purpose**: Run pytest with coverage reporting

**Key Features**:
- UV integration (not pip!)
- Coverage reporting built-in
- Customizable test command
- Working directory support
- Pre-install command support

---

## Test Plan

### Phase 1: Passing Tests (Should Pass ‚úÖ)

**Purpose**: Verify valid Python tests pass with coverage.

**Test Cases**:
1. **Simple tests** - Basic pytest test functions
2. **Complex tests** - Fixtures, parametrize, classes
3. **Full coverage** - 100% coverage on tested modules
4. **Multiple files** - Several test files with different patterns
5. **UV dependencies** - Verify uv sync works correctly

**Expected**: All checks pass, coverage reported correctly.

---

### Phase 2: Failing Tests (Should Fail ‚ùå)

**Purpose**: Verify pytest catches all test failures.

**Test Cases**:
1. **Assertion failures** - Tests with failed assertions
2. **Exception raising** - Unhandled exceptions in tests
3. **Import errors** - Missing modules or incorrect imports
4. **Syntax errors** - Invalid Python syntax in test files
5. **Type errors** - Type mismatches causing failures
6. **Multiple failures** - Several failing tests in one file

**Expected**: Workflow fails immediately when tests fail.

---

### Phase 3: Coverage Requirements (Should Fail ‚ùå)

**Purpose**: Verify coverage thresholds are enforced.

**Test Cases**:
1. **Low coverage** - Tests covering < 80% of code
2. **Missing functions** - Untested functions in module
3. **Missing branches** - Untested if/else branches
4. **Uncovered files** - Source files with no tests
5. **Coverage report** - Verify --cov-report=term-missing works

**Expected**: Workflow fails when coverage is insufficient.

---

### Phase 4: Edge Cases (Should Fail ‚ùå)

**Purpose**: Test complex scenarios and bypass attempts.

**Test Cases**:
1. **No tests found** - Empty test directory
2. **Warnings** - Tests that produce warnings
3. **Skipped tests** - @pytest.mark.skip decorator
4. **XFail tests** - @pytest.mark.xfail decorator
5. **Mixed results** - Some pass, some fail
6. **Coverage bypass** - Attempts to disable coverage
7. **Import-time errors** - Errors during test collection
8. **UV integration** - Verify pip is NOT used

**Expected**: All violations caught, no false negatives.
